## Draft Response

In the past 12 months, PolicyEngine's API calculations reached over 100,000 Americans through partner organizations including MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Mirza, and Student Basic Needs Coalition across Colorado, California, North Carolina, and expanding jurisdictions—providing accurate benefit eligibility information to people who previously lacked access to these calculations (source: [NEEDS SOURCE - partner API usage data? internal tracking?]).

Our comprehensive coverage distinguishes us: we calculate individual tax programs including credits federally and in all 50 states, validated against NBER's TAXSIM (with MOU to replace it) and Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database. We cover SNAP, Medicaid, healthcare subsidies, nutrition assistance, and disability benefits nationwide, plus cash welfare, childcare subsidies, energy assistance, housing vouchers, and state supplements in deployed jurisdictions. Partners can screen clients for dozens of programs simultaneously with to-the-dollar accuracy.

Beyond individual assistance, PolicyEngine serves policy analysis. When Colorado policymakers considered benefit cliff reforms, our microsimulation modeled impacts across income levels—enabling stakeholders across the political spectrum to understand trade-offs. This neutral infrastructure serves democratic deliberation.

2025 brought Massachusetts and Illinois launches, with Texas, NYC, and DC deployments pending for early 2026. Our 100% open-source development on GitHub, backed by NSF, Arnold Ventures, and NEO Philanthropy, ensures transparency and reproducibility.

Technical advances enabled this scale: we enhanced our policy explanations using AI (policyengine.org/us/ai) to help users understand not just what benefits they qualify for, but why. Natural language explanations transform opaque eligibility rules into accessible guidance, supporting both benefit access and civic understanding.
