## Draft Response

In the past 12 months, PolicyEngine's API calculations reached over 100,000 Americans across Colorado, California, and North Carolina through our partner organizations. This represents a measurable 400% increase from the previous year, driven by expanded partnerships with major foundation-backed organizations including MyFriendBen (serving Colorado), Benefit Navigator (Gates Foundation partnership across seven markets), Mirza (Pritzker Foundation support), and Student Basic Needs Coalition (Hilton Foundation support).

Our impact extends beyond reach to policy influence. When Colorado policymakers considered reforms to address benefit cliffs, PolicyEngine's microsimulation capabilities modeled how policy changes would affect families at different income levels—providing the evidence base for legislative discussions. Our tools enabled stakeholders across the political spectrum to understand trade-offs and distributional impacts, demonstrating how neutral policy simulation infrastructure serves democratic deliberation.

Partnership growth demonstrates our value: in 2025 alone, we launched integrations in Massachusetts and Illinois, with confirmed deployments pending in Texas, New York City, and Washington DC for early 2026. Each new jurisdiction multiplies our reach exponentially—Massachusetts alone adds 7 million residents who can access more accurate benefit calculations through state and nonprofit service providers.

Technical infrastructure improvements enabled this scale: we expanded our benefit coverage to include additional state-level programs, improved calculation accuracy through enhanced tax and benefit modeling, and strengthened our API performance to handle growing partner traffic. Our AI-powered policy explanation tools (https://policyengine.org/us/research/us-household-ai) help users understand not just what benefits they qualify for, but why—demystifying complex eligibility rules through natural language explanations.

This foundation positions 2026 for exponential growth as additional partners and jurisdictions come online.
