# Question 4: AI Strategy and Vision

**Word Limit**: Maximum 300 words

## Prompt
How is your organization currently thinking about AI in relation to your mission and community impact?

**Note**: There is no expectation that you're already using AI. We'd like to learn where you are today – whether you have not considered it, are actively exploring possibilities, or already applying AI – and how you think it could help achieve your goals or be used for community benefit.

## Draft Response

AI is fundamental to how PSL Foundation—through PolicyEngine—advances accessible policy understanding. We're actively deploying AI in two complementary ways:

**In Our Development Process**: Our entire engineering team uses AI coding agents daily. When California updates SNAP rules, we use AI to research policy changes, generate test cases ensuring accurate implementation, translate legislative language into Python code, and improve our API architecture. This dramatically accelerates our ability to keep pace with constantly changing benefit rules across 50 states plus federal programs—a computational challenge that would overwhelm traditional development approaches.

**In Our Public Tools**: We've deployed AI-powered calculation explanations (policyengine.org/us/ai) that make our results transparent and understandable. When PolicyEngine calculates someone's SNAP benefit at $322/month, AI explains the intermediate steps: the maximum allotment for their household size, deductions from countable income due to shelter costs, earnings, childcare expenses, the expected contribution, and how these combine to reach that figure. This AI-generated transparency works across any program and household in our system—no hardcoding required.

Our vision extends this further: AI could enable natural language questions about eligibility and benefit cliffs, help caseworkers understand unfamiliar policy interactions, and identify potentially eligible individuals. The challenge is expanding these capabilities while maintaining the accuracy and transparency that vulnerable communities deserve.

The challenge is doing this responsibly—AI must provide accurate, verifiable calculations (which our microsimulation engine guarantees) while making explanations accessible. We see enormous potential in AI's ability to make safety net policies understandable to everyone who needs them, but only if the underlying calculations remain transparent and reproducible—PSL Foundation's core mission.

This unrestricted support would accelerate our AI capabilities while maintaining the transparency and accuracy that vulnerable communities deserve.
