# Question 4: AI Strategy and Vision

## Prompt
How is your organization currently thinking about AI in relation to your mission and community impact?

**Note**: There is no expectation that you're already using AI. We'd like to learn where you are today – whether you have not considered it, are actively exploring possibilities, or already applying AI – and how you think it could help achieve your goals or be used for community benefit.

## Draft Response

AI is fundamental to how PSL Foundation—through PolicyEngine—advances accessible policy understanding. We're actively deploying AI in three ways:

**Development Process**: Our entire team uses AI coding agents daily. When California updates SNAP rules, we use AI to research policy changes, generate test cases, translate legislative language into Python code, and improve our API architecture. This accelerates keeping pace with constantly changing benefit rules across 50 states plus federal programs.

**Data Infrastructure**: We use machine learning to build representative household datasets for each state and congressional district, integrating and calibrating dozens of disparate data sources. These datasets enable policy simulation and local-area benefit eligibility estimation with unprecedented precision—helping communities understand how many residents may be eligible for and claiming benefits in their area.

**Public Tools**: We've deployed AI-powered calculation explanations (policyengine.org/us/ai) that make results transparent. When PolicyEngine calculates someone's SNAP benefit at $322/month, AI explains the steps: maximum allotment, deductions for shelter/earnings/childcare, expected contribution. This works flexibly across all programs without hardcoding.

Our vision extends this: refining ML datasets to county and city levels for hyper-local benefit access targeting, enabling natural language policy questions, conducting research on claiming patterns. AI could help caseworkers understand unfamiliar program interactions and identify eligible individuals.

The challenge is maintaining accuracy alongside accessibility—AI explanations must match our microsimulation engine's verified calculations. This unrestricted support would accelerate our AI capabilities while preserving the transparency and accuracy that vulnerable communities deserve.
