# Question 4: AI Strategy and Vision

## Prompt
How is your organization currently thinking about AI in relation to your mission and community impact?

**Note**: There is no expectation that you're already using AI. We'd like to learn where you are today – whether you have not considered it, are actively exploring possibilities, or already applying AI – and how you think it could help achieve your goals or be used for community benefit.

## Draft Response

AI is fundamental to how PSL Foundation—through PolicyEngine—advances accessible policy understanding. We're actively deploying AI in two complementary ways:

**In Our Development Process**: Our entire engineering team uses AI coding agents daily. When California updates SNAP rules, we use AI to research policy changes, generate test cases ensuring accurate implementation, translate legislative language into Python code, and improve our API architecture. This dramatically accelerates our ability to keep pace with constantly changing benefit rules across 50 states plus federal programs—a computational challenge that would overwhelm traditional development approaches.

**In Our Public Tools**: We've deployed AI-powered policy explanation (https://policyengine.org/us/research/us-household-ai) that translates complex eligibility rules into natural language. When someone asks "Why don't I qualify for SNAP?" or "How will this job offer affect my benefits?", AI helps explain the underlying policy mechanics—transforming opaque bureaucratic rules into understandable guidance.

Our vision extends this further: AI can demystify benefit cliffs by explaining in plain language how earning $1,000 more affects your total economic situation across multiple programs. It can help caseworkers understand policy interactions they haven't encountered before. It can identify eligible individuals who don't know to ask.

The challenge is doing this responsibly—AI must provide accurate, verifiable calculations (which our microsimulation engine guarantees) while making explanations accessible. We see enormous potential in AI's ability to make safety net policies understandable to everyone who needs them, but only if the underlying calculations remain transparent and reproducible—PSL Foundation's core mission.

This unrestricted support would accelerate our AI capabilities while maintaining the transparency and accuracy that vulnerable communities deserve.
