### Critical - Required Information

1. **Q3 Source for 100K Figure**
   - Need source citation for "100,000+ Americans reached"
   - Options: Partner API usage data, internal tracking, partner reports

3. **Required Documents**

### Recommended - Strengthen Application

4. **Focus Area Selection**
   - Decide which to check:
     - ☐ AI Literacy & Public Understanding (YES - AI explanations)
     - ☐ Community Innovation (YES - ML datasets, partner ecosystem)
     - ☐ Economic Opportunity (YES - benefit access, economic mobility)
   - Recommendation: Check all three

5. **Optional Supplemental Materials**
