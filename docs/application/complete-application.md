## Question 1

**Word Limit**: 250 words
**Current Count**: 208 words

### Prompt

Please give an overview of your organization including your mission statement.

### Response

PSL Foundation's mission is to advance accessible and reproducible computing in the analysis of public policy. We steward three major open-source initiatives: the Policy Simulation Library, QuantEcon, and PolicyEngine.

PolicyEngine, our flagship project, builds open-source tools providing to-the-dollar benefit calculations and tax policy analysis, using AI to make complex policies accessible. Our API calculates eligibility and amounts for dozens of programs: individual tax credits federally and in all states (with MOUs to validate against NBER's TAXSIM and Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database), plus SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, ACA subsidies, WIC, and SSI nationwide, with cash welfare, childcare subsidies, energy assistance, housing vouchers, healthcare subsidies, and other state programs in deployed jurisdictions.

This infrastructure powers partner organizations—MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Mirza, Student Basic Needs Coalition—serving over 100,000 Americans in the past year. Major foundations (Gates, Pritzker, Hilton) support this ecosystem. Recent Massachusetts and Illinois launches, with upcoming Texas, NYC, and DC deployments, expand reach in 2026.

All development happens openly on GitHub. NSF, Arnold Ventures, and NEO Philanthropy provide our core institutional support.

PSL Foundation takes no policy positions—we build neutral tools serving policymakers and service providers across all perspectives. AI powers both our development (coding agents for policy research and implementation) and our public tools (demystifying complex safety net policies).

## Question 2

**Word Limit**: 300 words
**Current Count**: 269 words

### Prompt

What is the urgent community need that your organization seeks to address? How are you meeting that need? How will this new funding be used to support your work?

### Response

Millions of Americans leave benefits unclaimed because safety net policies are bewilderingly complex. A parent might not realize they qualify for SNAP, or a student might miss healthcare subsidies—not because programs don't exist, but because eligibility requires navigating overlapping federal, state, and local rules that even caseworkers struggle to apply consistently.

PolicyEngine addresses this through APIs providing to-the-dollar calculations across dozens of programs: tax credits federally and in all states (validated against NBER's TAXSIM and Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database), plus SNAP, Medicaid, healthcare subsidies, nutrition assistance, and disability benefits nationwide, with cash welfare, childcare subsidies, energy assistance, and housing vouchers in deployed states. When someone uses MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, or Student Basic Needs Coalition, PolicyEngine's calculations—integrated directly into their workflows—help discover economic supports they're entitled to.

This especially matters for benefit cliffs: when earning more triggers benefit losses exceeding wage gains. PolicyEngine helps families model how career advancement affects their total economic picture, enabling informed decisions about education, employment, and upward mobility.

Our reach demonstrates urgent demand: 100,000+ Americans served in the past year, with new Massachusetts and Illinois deployments and upcoming launches in Texas, NYC, and DC. All development happens openly on GitHub, backed by NSF, Arnold Ventures, and NEO Philanthropy.

Unrestricted funding will advance our AI work specifically: expanding ML datasets to additional localities, integrating PolicyEngine into AI assistants through MCP server protocols for personalized benefit guidance, enhancing AI-powered explanations for additional programs, and scaling our team's use of AI agents to maintain accuracy as policies change nationwide.

Because PolicyEngine powers the benefit access ecosystem, strengthening our foundation multiplies impact across every partner serving vulnerable communities.

## Question 3

**Word Limit**: 300 words
**Current Count**: 240 words

### Prompt

What has been the impact of your work over the past 12 months? Please include either (a) how many people you directly served and one measurable change (with its source), or (b) one concrete story that illustrates a change.

### Response

In the past 12 months, PolicyEngine's API calculations reached over 100,000 Americans through partner organizations including MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Mirza, and Student Basic Needs Coalition across Colorado, California, North Carolina, and expanding jurisdictions—providing accurate benefit eligibility information to people who previously lacked access to these calculations (source: [NEEDS SOURCE - partner API usage data? internal tracking?]).

Our comprehensive coverage distinguishes us: we calculate individual tax programs including credits federally and in all 50 states, validated against NBER's TAXSIM (with MOU to replace it) and Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database. We cover SNAP, Medicaid, healthcare subsidies, nutrition assistance, and disability benefits nationwide, plus cash welfare, childcare subsidies, energy assistance, housing vouchers, and state supplements in deployed jurisdictions. Partners can screen clients for dozens of programs simultaneously with to-the-dollar accuracy.

Beyond individual assistance, PolicyEngine serves policy analysis. When Colorado policymakers considered benefit cliff reforms, our microsimulation modeled impacts across income levels—enabling stakeholders across the political spectrum to understand trade-offs. This neutral infrastructure serves democratic deliberation.

2025 brought Massachusetts and Illinois launches, with Texas, NYC, and DC deployments pending for early 2026. Our 100% open-source development on GitHub, backed by NSF, Arnold Ventures, and NEO Philanthropy, ensures transparency and reproducibility.

Technical advances enabled this scale: we enhanced our policy explanations using AI (policyengine.org/us/ai) to help users understand not just what benefits they qualify for, but why. Natural language explanations transform opaque eligibility rules into accessible guidance, supporting both benefit access and civic understanding.

## Question 4

**Word Limit**: 300 words
**Current Count**: 274 words

### Prompt

How is your organization currently thinking about AI in relation to your mission and community impact?

### Response

AI is fundamental to how PSL Foundation—through PolicyEngine—advances accessible policy understanding. We're actively deploying AI in three ways:

**Development Process**: Our entire team uses AI coding agents daily. When California updates SNAP rules, we use AI to research policy changes, generate test cases, translate legislative language into Python code, and improve our API architecture. This accelerates keeping pace with constantly changing benefit rules across 50 states plus federal programs.

**Data Infrastructure**: We use machine learning to build representative household datasets for each state and congressional district, integrating and calibrating dozens of disparate data sources. These datasets enable policy simulation and local-area benefit eligibility estimation with unprecedented precision—helping communities understand how many residents may be eligible for and claiming benefits in their area.

**Public Tools**: We've deployed AI-powered calculation explanations (policyengine.org/us/ai) that make results transparent. When PolicyEngine calculates someone's SNAP benefit at $322/month, AI explains the steps: maximum allotment, deductions for shelter/earnings/childcare, expected contribution. This works flexibly across all programs without hardcoding.

We're expanding AI integration further: we're experimenting with MCP servers to make benefit calculations available within AI assistants, enabling personalized eligibility insights. Inspired by ChatGPT's app integrations, we envision delivering benefit guidance natively within AI interfaces where people already seek help—meeting vulnerable populations where they are rather than requiring them to find us.

Our broader vision: refining ML datasets to county and city levels for hyper-local targeting, enabling natural language policy questions, conducting research on claiming patterns to guide outreach.

The challenge is maintaining accuracy alongside accessibility—AI explanations must match our microsimulation engine's verified calculations. This unrestricted support would accelerate our AI capabilities while preserving the transparency and accuracy that vulnerable communities deserve.
