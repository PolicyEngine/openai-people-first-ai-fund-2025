## Draft Response

PSL Foundation's mission is to advance accessible and reproducible computing in the analysis of public policy. We serve as fiscal sponsor and steward for three major open-source initiatives: the Policy Simulation Library, QuantEcon, and PolicyEngine.

PolicyEngine, our flagship project focused on economic opportunity, builds AI-powered tools that democratize access to benefit programs and tax policy analysis. Through PolicyEngine's API, we provide free, accurate calculations for SNAP, Medicaid, tax credits, and dozens of other programs—helping Americans understand their eligibility and navigate benefit cliffs as they advance economically.

Our partner ecosystem includes MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator (Gates Foundation-supported), Mirza (Pritzker Foundation-supported), and Student Basic Needs Coalition (Hilton Foundation-supported). Through these partnerships, PolicyEngine reached over 100,000 Americans in the past year across Colorado, California, and North Carolina. Recent launches in Massachusetts and Illinois, with upcoming deployments in Texas, NYC, and DC, position us for exponential growth in 2026.

PSL Foundation and its projects take no policy positions. We build neutral, transparent tools that policymakers, researchers, and service providers across all perspectives use to understand policy mechanics and serve their communities.

AI is central to our work: our team uses coding agents daily for policy research, test case development, and software architecture, while our public-facing tools employ AI to demystify complex safety net policies and make them accessible to everyone.
