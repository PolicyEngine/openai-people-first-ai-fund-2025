## Draft Response

PSL Foundation's mission is to advance accessible and reproducible computing in the analysis of public policy. We steward three major open-source initiatives: the Policy Simulation Library, QuantEcon, and PolicyEngine.

PolicyEngine, our flagship project, builds open-source tools providing to-the-dollar benefit calculations and tax policy analysis, using AI to make complex policies accessible. Our API calculates eligibility and amounts for dozens of programs: individual tax credits federally and in all states (with MOUs to validate against NBER's TAXSIM and Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database), plus SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, ACA subsidies, WIC, and SSI nationwide, with cash welfare, childcare subsidies, energy assistance, housing vouchers, healthcare subsidies, and other state programs in deployed jurisdictions.

This infrastructure powers partner organizations—MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, Mirza, Student Basic Needs Coalition—serving over 100,000 Americans in the past year. Major foundations (Gates, Pritzker, Hilton) support this ecosystem. Recent Massachusetts and Illinois launches, with upcoming Texas, NYC, and DC deployments, expand reach in 2026.

All development happens openly on GitHub. NSF, Arnold Ventures, and NEO Philanthropy provide our core institutional support.

PSL Foundation takes no policy positions—we build neutral tools serving policymakers and service providers across all perspectives. AI powers both our development (coding agents for policy research and implementation) and our public tools (demystifying complex safety net policies).
