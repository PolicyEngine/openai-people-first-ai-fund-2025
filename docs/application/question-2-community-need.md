# Question 2: Community Need and Use of Funding

**Word Limit**: Maximum 300 words
**Current Count**: [TBD]

## Prompt
What is the urgent community need that your organization seeks to address? How are you meeting that need? How will this new funding be used to support your work?

## Draft Response

Millions of Americans leave critical benefits unclaimed because safety net policies are bewilderingly complex. A Colorado parent might not realize they qualify for SNAP, or a student in California might miss healthcare subsidies—not because programs don't exist, but because understanding eligibility requires navigating overlapping federal, state, and local rules that even caseworkers struggle to apply consistently.

PolicyEngine addresses this through AI-powered APIs that instantly calculate eligibility and benefit amounts across programs. Our tools integrate directly into service providers' workflows: when someone uses MyFriendBen in Colorado, Benefit Navigator in seven markets, or campus resources through Student Basic Needs Coalition, PolicyEngine's calculations help them discover and access economic supports they're entitled to.

This matters especially for benefit cliffs—when earning more money triggers benefit losses that exceed wage gains. PolicyEngine helps families model how career advancement affects their total economic picture, enabling informed decisions about education, employment, and upward mobility.

Our reach demonstrates urgent demand: 100,000+ Americans served in the past year, with major foundation support (Gates, Pritzker, Hilton) backing our partners. New state deployments in Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, NYC, and DC will exponentially expand this impact in 2026.

Unrestricted funding will support critical needs across our operations: expanding our engineering team to scale our API infrastructure for growing demand, enhancing AI capabilities to better explain policy mechanics, improving calculation accuracy as rules change, and supporting our partner success team that ensures service providers can effectively deploy our tools.

Because PolicyEngine powers the benefit access ecosystem, strengthening our foundation multiplies impact across every partner serving vulnerable communities.
