# Question 2: Community Need and Use of Funding

**Word Limit**: Maximum 300 words
**Current Count**: [TBD]

## Prompt
What is the urgent community need that your organization seeks to address? How are you meeting that need? How will this new funding be used to support your work?

## Draft Response

Millions of Americans leave benefits unclaimed because safety net policies are bewilderingly complex. A parent might not realize they qualify for SNAP, or a student might miss healthcare subsidies—not because programs don't exist, but because eligibility requires navigating overlapping federal, state, and local rules that even caseworkers struggle to apply consistently.

PolicyEngine addresses this through AI-powered APIs providing to-the-dollar calculations across dozens of programs: tax credits federally and in all states (validated against NBER's TAXSIM and Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database), plus SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, ACA subsidies, WIC, SSI nationwide, and state-specific programs like TANF and CCDF. When someone uses MyFriendBen, Benefit Navigator, or Student Basic Needs Coalition, PolicyEngine's calculations—integrated directly into their workflows—help discover economic supports they're entitled to.

This especially matters for benefit cliffs: when earning more triggers benefit losses exceeding wage gains. PolicyEngine helps families model how career advancement affects their total economic picture, enabling informed decisions about education, employment, and upward mobility.

Our reach demonstrates urgent demand: 100,000+ Americans served in the past year, with new Massachusetts and Illinois deployments and upcoming launches in Texas, NYC, and DC. All development happens openly on GitHub, backed by NSF, Arnold Ventures, and NEO Philanthropy.

Unrestricted funding supports critical operational needs: expanding engineering to scale API infrastructure for growing demand, enhancing AI capabilities to better explain policy mechanics, maintaining calculation accuracy as rules change, and supporting partner success to ensure effective deployment.

Because PolicyEngine powers the benefit access ecosystem, strengthening our foundation multiplies impact across every partner serving vulnerable communities.
